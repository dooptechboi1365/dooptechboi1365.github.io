    <p>
        oh the Boiman SMP <br>
        so, so wacky <br>
        the members are lacking, lacking <br>
        of some control <br>
<br>
        There is this first guy, TNGS <br>
        who likes to say "hell" <br>
        there is also this girl <br>
        who is named Lolwhat <br>
<br>
        the guy Zerolynche <br>
        usually makes trouble <br>
        he usually got argued <br>
        by TNGS and some others <br>
<br>
        Seaking Samurai is the owner <br>
        Pidgey his alt <br>
        Charles is the loyal one <br>
        but often he is offline <br>
 <br>
        Have I exhausted you guys <br>
        if you were in my position <br>
        As the owner, as the manager <br>
        of 30 members in a server?
